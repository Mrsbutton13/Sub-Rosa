            You know when you have that creepy story to tell? That strange noise you heard?
            Your bedroom door slowly opening, and nobody there? Well blog about those experiences.
            You can also read about other experiences. Post that picture, or that video, let it all out. 
            It's simple Sub-Rosa is blogs for supernatural experiences.
